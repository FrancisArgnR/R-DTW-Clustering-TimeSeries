# Clustering time series with DTW in R

Time series clustering is the division of the time series into different groups based on the similarity between them, so that the similar time series are in the same group.

## 1st step. Calculate the distance or similarity metric.

  - Euclidean
  - DTW (Dinamic Time Warping)

## 2nd step. Apply clustering techniques.

  - Partitional clustering
  - Hierarchical clustering
  - Fuzzy clustering
